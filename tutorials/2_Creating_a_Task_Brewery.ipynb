    "# Creating a task with the Brewery model\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is dedicated to tutorials on how to create a Task in the library. This step is essential as all the experiments in the library are performed on Tasks. A Task behaves as a function: it takes inputs, performs an evaluation and outputs the results. A Task defines a specific computation using a simulator. For example if we have a supply chain simulator one task may compute the profit given some input demand, and another task may compute the service level given some inventory policy input. The tasks are different but rely on the same simulator. The task therefore allows to specify which inputs we want to experiment with, to pre-process these inputs, to evaluate a simulator and to post-process the outputs of the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to perform an experimentation on the Brewery model (e.g an optimization). For this we have to specify which KPI we want to optimize and with respect to which input parameters. A Task allows this specification in a way such that the experiment is able to run the task automatically. This tutorial explains how to define such a task."
