    "# Uncertainty Analysis\n",

    "## The Brewery model\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the previous tutorial, we are working with the Brewery model. It is a drink consumption model including stock level management and customer satisfaction dynamics. The model input parameters that we will deal with are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `NbWaiters`: number of waiters in the bar\n",
    "- `RestockQty`: a fix quantity of drinks added to the current stock of the bar once it reaches a threshold value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brewery model has no default outputs as the value of all attributes at the end of a simulation can be considered as an output. In our case we will use the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `AverageSatisfaction`: average customer satisfaction\n",
    " - `Stock`: stock of the bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we suppose that the model's inputs (i.e `NbWaiters` and `RestockQty`) are uncertain. The model remains deterministic. We want to answer the following question: **How are the average customer satisfaction and the stock affected by the uncertainty on the model's inputs?** "

    "## The approach\n",
    "An uncertainty analysis requires to specify precisely what is the task we are experimenting with: what are its inputs and ouputs? In our case the inputs are `NbWaiters` and `RestockQty`, while the outputs are the `AverageSatisfaction` and `Stock`. Along with that we need to precisely specify the uncertainty on the input variables. In this study, we will model the uncertainty on the inputs with two **uniform discrete distributions**. The uncertainty analysis will then return the default statistics for the variability of the `AverageSatisfaction` and the `Stock`: mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, 95% confidence interval of the estimated mean. These results will be used to answer the question raised in the problem statement."
