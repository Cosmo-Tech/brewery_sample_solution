    "# Uncertainty Analysis\n",

    "## The Brewery model\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the previous tutorial we are working with the Brewery model. It is a drink consumption model including stock level management and customer satisfaction dynamics. The model input parameters that we will deal with are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- NBWaiters: the number of waiters in the bar\n",
    "- RestockQty: a fix quantity of drinks added to the current stock of the bar once it reaches a treshold value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brewery model has no default outputs as the value of all attributes at the end of a simulation can be considered as an output. In our case we will use the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - AverageSatisfaction: the average customer satisfaction\n",
    " - Stock: the stock of the bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we suppose that the model's inputs (i.e NBWaiters and RestockQty) are uncertain. The model remains deterministic. We want to answer the following question: **How are the AverageSatisfaction and the stock affected by the uncertainty on the model's inputs?** "

    "## The approach\n",
    "An uncertainty analysis requires to specify precisely what is the task we are experimenting with: what are its inputs and ouputs? In our case the inputs are NBWaiters, RestockQty and the outputs are the AverageSatisfaction and the Stock. Along with that we need to precisely specify the uncertainty on the input variables. In this study, we will model the uncertainty on the inputs with two  uniform discrete distributions. The uncertainty analysis will then return the default statistics for the variability of the AverageSatisfaction and the Stock: mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, 95% confidence interval of the estimated mean. These results will be used to answer the question raised in the problem statement."
